            <h2 class="about-header">Here's a time line of C. Odumegwu Ojukwu's life:</h2>
            <br>
            <ul class="about-content">
                <li><strong>1933</strong> - Chukwuemeka "Emeka" Odumegwu-Ojukwu was born on 4 November 1933 at Zungeru in northern Nigeria to Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu.</li>
                <li><strong>1943</strong> - Emeka Ojukwu started his secondary school education at CMS Grammar School, Lagos aged 10.</li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> -  He was transferred to King's College Lagos, where he was involved in a controversy leading to his brief imprisonment for assaulting a British teacher who put down a student strike action that he was a part of. This event generated widespread coverage in local newspapers.</li>
                <li><strong>1956</strong> -  His father sent him overseas to study in the United Kingdom, first at Epsom College and later at Lincoln College, Oxford University, where he earned a master's degree in History. He returned to colonial Nigeria.</li>
                <li><strong>1957</strong> -  Ojukwu joined the civil service in Eastern Nigeria as an Administrative Officer at Udi, in present-day Enugu State.</li>
                <li><strong>1958</strong> -  Emeka proceeded first, to the Royal West African Frontier Force Training School in Teshie, Ghana and next, to Eaton Hall where he received his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant. He was one of the first and few university graduates to receive an army commission.</li>
                <li><strong>1964</strong> -  After serving in the United Nations’ peacekeeping force in the Congo, under Major General Johnson Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi, Ojukwu was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and posted to Kano, where he was in charge of the 5th Battalion of the Nigerian Army..</li>
                <li><strong>1966</strong> - Lieutenant-Colonel Ojukwu was in Kano, northern Nigeria, when Major Patrick Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu on 15 January 1966 executed and announced the bloody military coup in Kaduna, also in northern Nigeria. It is to Ojukwu's credit that the coup lost much steam in the north.</li>
                <li><strong>1967</strong> - The Nigerian military leadership went to Aburi, Ghana, for a peace conference hosted by General Joseph Ankrah. The implementation of the agreements reached Aburi fell apart upon the leaderships return to Nigeria and on 30 May 1967, as a result of this, Colonel Odumegwu-Ojukwu declared Eastern Nigeria a sovereign state to be known as Biafra.</li>
                <li><strong>1968</strong> - there was the Niamey Peace Conference under President Hamani Diori (1968) and the OAU-sponsored Addis Ababa Conference (1968) under the chairmanship of Emperor Haile Selassie. This was the final effort by Generals Ojukwu and Gowon to settle the conflict via diplomacy. After three years of fighting and starvation, a hole appeared in the Biafran front lines and this was exploited by the Nigerian military. As it became obvious that the war was lost.</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - Ojukwu was convinced to leave the country to avoid assassination.[28] On 9 January 1970, he handed over power to his second in command, Chief of General Staff Major-General Philip Effiong, and left for Ivory Coast, where President Félix Houphouët-Boigny – who had recognised Biafra on 14 May 1968 – granted him political asylum.</li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong> -  Ikemba Odumegwu Ojukwu died in the United Kingdom after a brief illness, aged 78.</li>
                <li><strong>2012</strong> -  The Nigerian Army accorded him the highest military accolade and conducted a funeral parade for him in Abuja.</li>
